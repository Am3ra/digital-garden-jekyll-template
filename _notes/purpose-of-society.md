What is the purpose of society?

What is the purpose of government?

- Monopoly on violence?
- Authority on truth?
- Arbiter of disputes?
- Backer of economy?

How did society arise?

These are some questions I think about while reading this article.

When analyzing society, I believe that the first place to look in is what life would be like without it.
For example, what would be the purpose for any two members of a species entering into a relationship, a partnership?
Between two or more entering into a society?

I would submit that the only possible reason (from a darwinian perspective), is that it was mutually beneficial for each member, and more specifically, the ability for the genes to reproduce [^1].
So, thinking in this way, in what ways does this type of partnership offer?

These are some I can think of quickly:

- first
- second
- third


[^1]: for more info on why I say genes and not members, I recommend reading *The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins.
