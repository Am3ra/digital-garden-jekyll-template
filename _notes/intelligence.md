Probably the most important source of information that I have on intelligence is the incredible paper [[On the Measure of Intelligence]].

My short layman definition is
> Ability to solve problems.

The more correct definition, given in the paper by Chollet, is badly paraphrased as

> Ability to solve problems within a specific scope, given an amount of experience.
