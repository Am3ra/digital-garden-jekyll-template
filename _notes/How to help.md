When I think about how to help people, I often think about [[Power]]. How to help the most people, it helps to be powerful. Of course, it makes sense theoretically: if **power** is the ability of someone to impose their will on the world, if they want to help, power only increases their ability to do so.

I think that on a personal level, it's usually rational to want to become more powerful in order to help more people, but I also think that it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you need to be powerful in order to help. In fact, I think that paradoxically, most people feel helpless to help. They think it's too hard. They think it's too expensive. Maybe they think that someone else will help, even when there's no one else. Maybe they think that they can't make a difference.

I've thought all those things. And yet I want to help. I don't know how. Let's try to break it down into pieces.
