I have taken many Philosophy courses in my life. Among the most important are those that deal with [[epistemology]].

To me, epistemology is (one of, if not) the most important field in philosophy. I think that it is especially important given that it is specifically foundational to most other areas of philosophy, as it establishes the limits or parameters of what we know, and how we come to know it.

Another branch of philosophy that seems to call to me is the philosophy of mind. What I mean by that is the philosophies that I came to by watching Lex Fridman interview specifically Joscha Bach. [This is a link to it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM) To me, it is foundational because of the concepts that it provides to describe the framework of our own consciousness, something that is foundational not only in the sense that it's literally how our consciousness exists, but also in the sense that it is foundational for most [[Deep Learning]] endeavors.

With regards to social/political philosophy, I am rather left-leaning [[todo]]
