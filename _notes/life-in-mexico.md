My life in mexico can be seperated into two halfs, my infancy, and end of highscool/[[university]] period.

## Infancy

Although I remember only very little of my infancy (seeing as I left at around 4 years old), what little I do remember, I remember fondly.

For example, one of what I consider to be my most important memories is in a car in Paseo Colon, and actively deciding not to be such a grouch anymore. I made a deal with myself to smile everytime I remember that moment, when I was about 4, and I still do.

In chronological order, I was born in Toluca, attended a montessori school, then left at around 4 years old, moving to [[houston]] for the first time.


## Young Adulthood

Returning from living in [[Houston]] the second time, I finished my last two years of high-school in Mexico, at the Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, or Tec for short. There, I completed the International Baccalaureate Program, after which I signed up to the [[university]], to study computer science.

During my third semester of university, I met [[Kari]].

During my 8th semester , I got a job in [[sparkademy]].

Who knows what the future will bring.
