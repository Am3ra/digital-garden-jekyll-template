# Trauma

## 2020-08-26

Today is a sad day. So was yesterday. So have many recent days. Jacob Blake was shot 7 times in the back. I think that maybe he had a warrant.

WHO CARES IF HE WAS IN THE WRONG? HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO DIE.

I'm feeling a profound sense of outrage. Outrage for the clear injustice that has been going on. Outrage for the ignorance, and even more for the willful ignorance. Outrage because not much has changed in the U.S.

I'm feeling proud. So damn proud that the basketball players decided to cancel their games in protest. I'm feeling proud of the self-reflection that American (though I hate that term) culture is doing right now. They're going through the painful process of trump.
