## Life

Cleanliness

If you're not working, relaxing, or having fun, better be cleaning.


## Work

1. Take care of your tools

A worker, is nothing without his tools, and the first and most important of all, is himself. Be healthy.
Clean your tools often.
Organize them.

2. Be on time

This is simple, but it is also important. If you can't keep your appointments, people *will* lose trust in you.

3. Do good work

Be proud about what you do, and do it carefully. If you can't be proud about what you're doing, be proud of why. If you can't do either, do something else.
