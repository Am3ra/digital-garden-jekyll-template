# Power

I often think about Power as a concept. Violence is clearly a form of power. I think that violence might be a form of power in which one limits the options of a person. I wonder what the opposite is — altruism? This conception of power is related of course, to utilitarianist frameworks.

In this conception of Power/Violence, (on a personal level) there is nothing more violent than killing someone, as that reduces the space of their options to zero, and nothing more anti-violent than birthing someone.

I guess that under this framework obligations are a form of violence. Maybe violence isn't the right word. Force. 

Power more generally, for me is the ability for someone ton impose their will on others. Power, of course, has many varieties, such as ability to influence people's choices through charisma or force. There's that word again.
