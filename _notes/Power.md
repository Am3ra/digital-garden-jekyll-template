I often think about Power as a concept. Violence is clearly a form of power. I think that violence might be a form of power in which one limits the options of a person. I wonder what the oposite is — altruism? This conception of power is related of course, to utilitarianist frameworks.

In this conception of Power/Violence, (on a personal level) there is nothing more violent than killing someone, as that reduces the space of their options to zero, and nothing more anti-violent than birthing someone.

I guess that under this framework obligations are a form of violence. Maybe violence isn't the right word. Force.
