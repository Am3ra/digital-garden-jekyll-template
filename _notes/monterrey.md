Monterrey is the home city of my [[university]].

I moved here in the middle of october 2021, after my [[surgery]]. Here I completed my bachelor's degree, and have lived ever since.

An incredible amount of family lives here, mostly from the Esparza side, although some Rubio and Arellano live here as well.

My general thoughts on the city are as follows (as of J. 2022):

A very american city, it has a distinct lack of cultural activities, compared to mexico city or even toluca/metepec. Generally ugly.

Near my [[university]], there are a lot of pretty great restaurants and things to do, and more importantly, my [[friends]].
