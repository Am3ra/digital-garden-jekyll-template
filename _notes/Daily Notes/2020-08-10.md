# 2020-08-10

Today I downloaded foam. Apparently, it's a great way to take notes.

Todo:

- [x] Begin notes on [[Deep Learning]]
- [x] Begin notes on [[Personal Philosophy]]
- [x] Begin notes on [[Life Story]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Deep Learning]: ../deep-learning "deep-learning"
[Personal Philosophy]: ../personal-philosophy "personal-philosophy"
[Life Story]: ../life-story "life-story"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
