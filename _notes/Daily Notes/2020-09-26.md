It's tough to let go. Of most things, I imagine. It's tough to let go of possessions, places, but most of all, I believe, people.

She probably deserves a whole section of my [[life-story]] devoted to her, but I felt it necessary to write my thoughts here.

Today I thought of finally letting her go.

It's tough to accept that she no longer loves me, that she considers me barely more than a friend. How did that come about? It's tough to accept that I'll probably never know.

Honestly, I never had the balls to break up with her. I loved her too much to bear the pain. I still do.

Let me be clear, she let me down as softly as I've ever heard, as I can even Imagine. It still hurt though.

Ah, man. It really does hurt, even now.
