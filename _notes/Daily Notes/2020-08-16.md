Today I came back from Almoloya. Some notes on recent activities:

- First, yesterday I went to an ENT doctor because I had a blocked ear. It was pretty weird/bad given that the ear that was blocked was the easiest/least painful ear to clean, and the one that wasn't ended up hurting me a lot. The doc did something weird, and my right ear ended up bleeding most of the night.
- Second, I saw Ceci Macedo yesterday, she went to have lunch/dinner in Almoloya.
- Third, today I finished my [[convolutional-neural-networks]] course! I'm pretty happy it's done, although I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. On to the next one!

I've been thinking a lot about my relationship with kari. I really love her, but i'm not sure if our current position is sustainable. Maybe it's just for fun. I don't know what to think.

I fixed the internet in metepec! That's pretty useful.

I've been thinking a lot about [[emotions]], I think i'll write an article on them.
