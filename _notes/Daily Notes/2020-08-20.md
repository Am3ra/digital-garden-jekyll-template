# 2020 08 20

Today I tried out Obsidian. It's an interesting editor, but I rather prefer VScode right now. 

I'm currently in my [[Dise単o y arquitectura de software]] class from [[7th semester]]. I'm not enjoying it.

Today was a rather important advance in my [[baseball project]]. I really advanced in my planning phase, setting up the todo. I feel like it really has quite a bit of promise.
