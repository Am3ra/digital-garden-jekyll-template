today I worked for a while, deploying a new learning platform.

More importantly, I saw my extremely dear [[Ruben]], and Diana. We ate a unique delicacy, called Marquesitas, and had coffee and Baklava at the turkish place here in [[metepec]].

We chatted at my house for a while, before parting ways. At night, I finally submitted my application for [[OpenAI]]. I'm so scared.

I wonder how much of this day I'll remember in the future? For sure I won't remember working today, but I hope I'll remember my friends.
