# Identity

I wonder what Juan Preciado thought as he walked into Comala, searching for his father, only to find a _Ghost Town_. To think you know where you come from, only to find reality vastly different from the picture painted by ancestral memories.

When I first arrived in Mexico, my mind wasn't preoccupied by the minutiae of actually moving to a new country — my parents would take care of that. No, instead I was thinking of what it would do to my Identity as a Mexican. I was right to think about that, because as I soon came to realize, there was a large cultural gap between me and my classmates. I didn't understand many of the cultural touchstones such as sayings, even historical dates. Hell, I didn't even know the language past the basics.

My grandfather, a psychiatrist of some renown, made sure to tell my father about the psychological importance of kids knowing where they’re from. Personally, I never had a doubt. While growing up abroad, I visited my hometown in Mexico often, and I even saw the hospital where I was born. I knew of my great-grandfather also being from my hometown, and of my ancestors and their story. I knew of my grandparents and cousins and uncles, and everyone else, even if I was a bit fuzzy on some of the details.

* Reading Pedro Páramo

Pedro Páramo was one of the first books I ever read in Spanish, And to be quite honest, I didn’t really understand it at first. The language barrier didn’t help, and it felt like a slog. I also wrote an essay about the book, but I mostly remember my teacher taking pity on me, and only covering most (not all!) of the paper in corrections.

<!-- Should cut right?  -->
One of my first clues to the myriad differences between American and Mexicana cultures was in writing an essay. Like almost anyone that has gone through the American school system in the last couple of decades, I learned to write essays using the hamburger method.

When I had my jaw surgery, I decided that that was the best moment to shave my head after growing out my hair. It took a couple of days to even recognize myself in the mirror, let alone the weeks it took to get used to the sight. For the first time, I had a jaw that aligned with the image that I had in my head. I had made my body aligned with my own internal idea/image of myself.





# Structure

I want to talk about what Identity means to me, how it is developed, my philosophy on it, and relate that to pedro paramo. Maybe turn that around, to how i developed my identity as a Mexican, and how that in turn developed my identity philosophy. I could set up a background about lacking identity and clashes with identity first.

    * half-baked identity — in mind, that doesn’t align with the identity I imagined
