topic: [[personal philosophy]]

I've been thinking about the concept of a dream job lately. Seems like an incredibly capitalist concept. Do people really dream of labor?

When people talk of a dream job, it seems more like they talk of an incredible lack of job.

Honestly, I feel like [[Capitalism]] encourages the [fetishim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetishism) or deep love for exploitation. Of course it benefits the rich if the working class attributes moral value to hard work.

For me, a dream job is no job.
