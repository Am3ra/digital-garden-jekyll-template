# Emotions

Emotions are a tricky thing. I think they really are something that give life its zest. Functionally, I subscribe to the theory that emotions are simply a control mechanism. According to what little I know about the [[Theory of Mind]], our consciousness is simply a heirarchy of control mechanisms. As an analogy to neural networks, emotions are a way for our brains to quickly change the weights and biases of our neurons in order to elicit a particular response. As an example, pain makes us try to avoid a particular situation, while happiness or sweetness that produces happiness makes us try to encourage certain situations.  

In my personal life, emotions have played an important role in many if not most decisions. My decision to stay in Toluca as long as I have was quite emotional, as my decision to leave. My romantic relationships have obviously also been emotional.
