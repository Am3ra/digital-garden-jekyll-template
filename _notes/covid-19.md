# COVID 1923`

Part of my [[life story]]

An incredible period of my life. I honestly believe that this is an incredible time period in terms of self-reflection, both on the individual as well as the societal level.

This period has been marked by several features:

- The death of hundredths of thousands.
  - Many lives also saved
  - Many incidental deaths - e.g. the deaths caused by lack of medical attention.
- The crash of many economies.
- The creative output of thousands

This has definitely been an inflection point in my life, turning me more intellectual and introspective. I've been lucky to have few worries.

Another marker of this pandemic and its corresponding lock-down, is the end of my relationship with Karina.
