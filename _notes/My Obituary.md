# My Obituary


We are all here to mourn the passing of Al and to appreciate how he enriched all of our lives...

All of us that knew Al well, thought of him as a kind, optimistic and loyal person. We are the lucky ones, the ones that had the privilege to know him well. Within the first 5 minutes of someone meeting Al, people knew that he was a thoughtful, funny and relaxed person. And they knew that they would always enjoy being around him.

He always treated his family in a supportive, devoted and empathetic way. Before writing this speech, I spoke with many of Al's friends. All of them described him as being helpful, out-going and sociable.

Al told me a story a few months ago about a time, way back in 2022 when he was just 23. He had an amazing girlfriend but he never wanted to walk down the ailse. But from everyone I have spoken to, he was the most affectionate, stable and loving partner in life that anyone could ask for.

Al had a very successful career as an entrepreneur. He was passionate about what he did and it brought freedom, satisfaction and abundance into his life.

Being so successful allowed him to help family, never worry about money and spend time with loved ones. It was his innovation, self-discipline and focus that made him so successful.

Many of you may not know this but Al had skills! He didn't talk about it much but he was an accomplished photographer, trumpeter and writer these skills brought a lot of joy into his life.

Al lived a long healthy life because he was an active person who looked after his body by eating healthy, lifting weights and dancing. We are all very thankful that he did and we will miss him dearly.
