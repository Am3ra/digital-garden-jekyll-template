# Deep Learning

Deep learning has a special significance to me.

The main ideas for me concerning Deep Learning are:

- The [[Coursera]] courses I've taken:
  1. [[Neural Networks and Deep Learning]]
  2. [[Hyperparameter tuning]]
  3. [[Structuring Machine Learning Projects]]
  4. [[Convolutional Neural Networks]]
  5. [[Sequence Models]]

## Notes on papers

An important acrivity while learning is to read scholarly papers in order to see the bleeding edge.
For that, it is important to take [[Notes on Papers]]
