Today I downloaded foam. Apparently, it's a great way to take notes.

Todo:

- [x] Begin notes on [[Deep Learning]]
- [x] Begin notes on [[Personal Philosophy]]
- [x] Begin notes on [[Life Story]]

[Deep Learning]: deep-learning "Deep Learning"
[Personal Philosophy]: personal-philosophy "Personal Philosophy"
[Life Story]: life-story "Life Story"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
