I've always had a love for knowing how things work. Truly, I think one of the first real efforts for this was reading "the big book of brains" or something with a title to that effect, that really explained some fundamental topics of the brain.

Later in life, this love would eventually manifest itself as a love for understanding and eventually building technology, but before that, it was a love for philosophy and knowledge itself.

My first real contact with epistemology, was interacting briefly with my brother, while he took a class on the Theory of Knowledge (TOK). This is a class that I would also eventually take, although in a different school and country.
