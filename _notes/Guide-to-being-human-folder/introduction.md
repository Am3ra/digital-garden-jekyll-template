# Foreword

The purpose of the guide, like almost all writing, is to order thoughts with the aim of transmitting them to another person. It's a way for me to meditate about life, and my way around it, and hell, maybe even connect with someone else on the way, and even help. In that sense, this is a very personal text, in that it transmits my philosophy, my innermost thoughts. It's what I would like to tell my children.

I hope you Find it useful.



# Introduction

This guide is meant to help people become (more) human. This is a thought that has been percolating inside of me for nearly a decade, since I first read Herbert's "Dune", and then distilled further with books such as "What we owe eachother" by Singer. I have a firm conviction that we do in fact owe eachother quite a bit, if not most everything, and that those of us who live good lives, do so more as a result of luck, than because of any other reason. Maybe that's wrong, and I'm the only lucky one out of all of us, but I do feel that the good parts of life — the friends and family that we have — we are lucky to have.

As a result, this guide aims to act as a divining rod, helping me steer my life in a more favourable direction. It contains a lof of incredibly basic information, in an effort to act as a reference for good living, in the same vein as the pocket reference book for engineers. 

It is divided into sections:

- The basics; How to meet basic needs.
- Community, the why and how.
- The game's rules, and how to win.



--------

The basics - Basic tips for living, health, house, and psychology. How to meet basic needs. Food. Exercise.

Community - The importance. Why we all need it, how it can help us, and how we can help eachother. How we can help form them.

Games rules - Philosophy, physics, sociology. A game that you can only win, if you set the right winning conditions. Every person sets them for themselves.
