# Chapter One: The very basics
What is the purpose of life? Your answer to that question is probably quite different to mine or to others’. In fact, you might not know what you want the purpose of your own life to be — most people don’t. While  _why_ you want to live is one of the most important things you can know/decide, it’s secondary in nature to living in the first place. 

It’s important to get the very basics of living right, so that the rest of your life can follow. While it might be important to you to be a good person, help others in your community, and in general lead an enjoyable life, it’s incredibly difficult to sustainably do almost anything, if you don’t get the basics right.

There are four main areas that I like to focus on:

- sleep
- food
- hygiene
- general health + fitness

In my opinion (and I hope it isn't too controversial), the primary objective of any person should be to stay alive. Now I understand that there may be exceptions, but as a general rule of thumb, I think that makes a lot of sense.

A part of being truly human, to me, is having a positive impact on your community. However, it's very difficult to take care of others, when you can't take care of yourself. Although this is something that most people should be able to do by themselves, these basic activities are also excellent opportunities for 

Staying alive has some basic components:

- food
- hygiene
- general health + fitness

These are the general items of day to day life that most people could reasonably aspire to complete. In Maslow's heirarchy of needs this is the very bottom. Compromises in these areas, while understandable and even common, have cascading effects in almost every area of life, and as such, should be avoided. These should be daily priorities.

## Sleep

Few things in life are as important to me as sleep is. Sleep affects your mood, your thoughts, and your ability in general to sleep. If you’re trying to get fitter, sleep dictates how quickly you can progress.
