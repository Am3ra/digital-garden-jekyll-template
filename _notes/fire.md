FIRE: Financial Independence, Retire Early.

Sort-of an anti-work philosophy, its purpose being to work as little as possible in life. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/

From its description:

Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Early Retirement/Retiring Early (RE) - quitting your job/career and pursuing other activities with your time. This subreddit deals primarily with Financial Independence, but additionally with some "RE" concepts.

At its core, FI/RE is about maximizing your savings rate (through less spending and/or earning higher income) to achieve FI and have the freedom to RE as soon as you wish. The purpose of this subreddit is to discuss FI/RE strategies, techniques, and lifestyles whether you are retired or not.

FI/RE is about:

- Discovering and achieving life goals: â€œWhat would I do with my life if I didn't have to work for money?"

- Simplifying and redesigning your lifestyle to reduce spending. Your wants and needs aren't written in stone, and less spending is powerful at any income level.

- Working to increase your income and income streams with projects, side-gigs, and additional effort

- Striving to save a large percentage (usually more than 50%) of your income to accelerate achieving FI

- Investing to make your money work for you, and learning to manage/optimize those investments for the unique nature of FI/RE

- Retiring Early

FI/RE is NOT about:

- Gaining wealth for the purpose of excessive consumption

- Taking the slow road, or the traditional road to retirement

Becoming financially independent requires hard work and a healthy attitude towards money, but also a degree of privilege. When participating on this subreddit, please be mindful of the ways in which you are lucky
