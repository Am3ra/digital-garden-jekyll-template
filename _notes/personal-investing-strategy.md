[[personal finances]]

My basic strategy for investing is to invest in a total world etf, namely $VT. This is, in short, an admittance of my ignorance in investing, and trust in the global markets in the long term.

Because of ignorance when buying the first stocks, and reluctance to change them (lol), my portafolio also has a US stock market tilt ($VTI)

Although the basic seeds of this strategy began to brew thanks to a planet money podcast, which described the vanguard ETF, and the opinion of warren buffet on the matter (I believe there was a bet on the topic), it became much more formal after watching videos on the topic made by the YouTube Channel PensionCraft.

This strategy is probably the lynchpin(sp?) of my [[fire]] strategy, helped in large part by my [[Finanzas personales]] class.
