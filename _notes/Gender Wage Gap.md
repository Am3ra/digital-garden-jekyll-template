I want to understand the wage gap more fully. Join me in an emporation of the data!

Does it exist? Is the 70c figure accurate? In what way?

According to the [aaw](https://www.aauw.org/app/uploads/2020/02/AAUW-2018-SimpleTruth-nsa.pdf) the gap is more accurately around 80c or 20%

Where? Are there different wage gaps per country? Which is the least different country?

What are the real distributions? Are there places where women earn more on average?

What's the breakdown by industry?

Does age play a role?

Are there mitigating factors?

What are the sources?

## Quote:
> women spent an average of 6.3 hours more per week doing household chores than men (15.5 versus 9.2 hours) and 2.4 hours more per week providing care to household members (4.4 versus 2.0 hours). Women also, on average, spent more time both purchasing goods and services and traveling related to unpaid household work per week than their male counterparts. Data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicates that American men spend 141 minutes per day on unpaid household labor, while women spend 245 minutes.

## The wage gap paradox

If I were to ask you in which you would expect the highest percentage of engineers to be female, what would you answer? Take a moment to think about it before you answer.

Let me give you the statistics:

Some Highest percentage of female engineers countries:

- Algeria
- Tunisia
- Turkey
- UAE
- Saudi Arabia
  

Some of the Lowest percentage countries:

- Chile
- Belgium
- Norway
- Netherlands

You get the picture. Well actually, here's an actual picture:

Here's another:

A simple though probably flawed conclusion to draw from this is simple: When women are freer to choose, they are less likely to choose high-paying engineering majors.

This topic is more complex than most people realize. So I only ask that you don't take what everyone tells you for granted, the data is super interesting.
