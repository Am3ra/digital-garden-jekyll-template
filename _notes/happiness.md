[[short trek]]

One aspect of life that should not be under-estimated is a focus on happiness.

Quite frankly, one of the bases of my [[personal philosophy]], and topics such as [[purpose of society]] is a maximization of personal pleasure.

Some basic factors are [[personal finances]] and [[personal health]], as well as social factors.

If you're looking to increase your own happiness, [[tetrafarmakos]] might be a good place to start.

## Financial aspect of happiness

As the saying goes,

> Money can't buy happiness.

Except for the fact that it kind of can. Poverty destroys health, both mental and physical, and increases personal risk, all things which can be detrimental for happiness.

On the other hand, some studies have found a correlation between personal income and happiness, up to a certain point. What this means is that although money can't buy infinite happiness, it *can* buy a base amount, and can reduce a lot of unhappiness

## Health aspect of happiness

## Social aspect of happiness

Something overlooked in increasing personal happiness, is increasing social, or group happiness. Often, increasing the happiness of those around you, increases your own personal happiness.
