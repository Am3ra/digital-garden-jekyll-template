A very significant part of my [[life story]].

I Finished my bachelor's degree in computer science in the:

## Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de [[Monterrey]]

I graduated december 2021, during the [[COVID 19]] lockdown.

I'm  done!


My overall experiee at the university has been interesting, starting in [[toluca]], and ending in [[Monterrey]]. Obviously, being the main campus, the monterrey campus was much more impressive.

I never really felt too extremely challenged, to my recollection. I was pretty relaxed during it all, though to be honest, I did dedicate a lot of time to technology, a likely reason for my success.

During my final semester, I had my jaw [[surgery]], and I started work in [[sparkademy]].
