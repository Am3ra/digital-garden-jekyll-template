An incredibly useful technique for study and work, and focus in general.

The premise is simple: Humans aren't made to be constantly focused, and the longer that they require focus, the more likely they are to lose it. For example, I listened to a podcast reecently, which included the interesting tidbit that nurse medical errors increase exponentially after 12 hours of work.

A simple solution then, is to take breaks, frequently. 

The pomodoro technique is as follows: You establish two lengths of time, Work time, and rest time, (personally, I use the values 45 and 15). When work time is over, you start rest time, and vice versa. Some pomodoro systems also use a long break after 3 cycles. The long break thends to be around 25-30 minutes.

Personally, this technique has saved me many times, especially since my attention span is so short.
