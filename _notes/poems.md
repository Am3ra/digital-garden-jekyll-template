# Poems

## Identity 2

I’ve worked harder
been here longer
more worthy than you

since I been born
since I’m so worn
since I can prove it to you

I’m this, you’re that
there’s no going back
I’m me and you’re you
there’s nothing to do
<!-- it’s true, no doubt -->
<!-- I know it be true -->

## Ghosts

I see some ghosts i only heard
before today
I heard their whispers when clapping hands
recalled the shamans and awe-struck peoples
but today I see the market guards
standing there where none are standing.

I see flat grounds where stalls sell foods
where children play and gossip rules.
