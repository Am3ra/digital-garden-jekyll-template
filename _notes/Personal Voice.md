[In his latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVaUoyabjAg), Destin from the YouTube channel Smarter Every Day talks about the pressures to alter your voice.

By voice, in this context, I'm talking about personal presentation; but not only *how* you talk and present yourself to the world, but *how* you do it. Always, there's a pressure to alter both the message *and* the presentation: Sometimes, talking or working on something that doesn't interest you as much will generate more interest than if you do it as authentically as possible.

This is a topic of vital importance to almost any endeavor, and can be resolved as almost every other dilemma: by  [[Defining Your Values]]. How important is authenticity to you? How important is Truth?

Here's a scenario: You're a science communicator, who helps teach scientific concept to people. If you change your video style to be much shorter, and contain less information, the social media algorithms will reward that with more views. Would you make your videos shorter?

The interesting part of this example is not the answer that you reach, but rather how you reach it: it's important to analyze one's own thought and decision-making process.

The trivial — though not obvious to many — answer to this scenario is as follows: How is your value system defined? If you value quantity if people reached over individual impact, or vice-versa, the answer is clear. Again, this depends on you [[Defining Your Values]].

How do you think of your Voice, what and how do you present to the world? Are you talking, working, and thinking on things that matter to you, in an authentic manner? If not, is the reasoning sufficient for you?
