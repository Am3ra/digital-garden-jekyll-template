## Theory

The theory is based on three pillars:

- [PMBook](#pmbook)
- [Agile](#agile)
- [CMMi/RUP](#cmmirup)

### PMBOOK

### Agile

A methodology to make processes much more "agile", in the sense that they are more able to quickly respond to changes,  as well as quickly producing working products.

Core tenets of the methodology are:

- Favor individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- focus on making working products, not documentation
- Collaborate with users, don't make things *for* them, make them *with* them.

#### Planning and requirements in Agile projects

((Adaptive VS Predictive methodology))

Main concepts:

- Try, fail, fail again better
- One-off activities vs continuous activities.
  - Analysis, design, programming, and testing are continuous activities.
- The beginning is more unpredictable than the end.
- The client (Product Owner) is fundamental, and should have an active role.
- No predefined roles

### CMMi/RUP

What is CMMi?

- It's an improvement strategy, and a method to better identify the main inefficiencies of various different types of processes.
- It's also a best-practices method. Serves as a guide to the best way of doing common things.

#### RUP team structures

## Practice

### Projects, Processes, portfolios

#### Project vs. processes

- They both have clear objectives. While both are done by people and restricted by resources, they have some differences.
- **Projects** have an end. They produce a product or service.
- **Processes** are repetitive and continuous. They look to *improve outcomes*

#### Programs and Portfolios

Programs are collections of projects that have a similar scope or purpose. Generally, these are grouped together in order to reduce costs and increase communication, as well as projects being inter-dependent.

Portfolios are collections of projects or programs. Portfolios generally have a wider scope than programs. Generally, portfolios' objectives are aimed at specific strategic objectives.

#### Stakeholders

People that are involved in the project in some way, the concept, use of the result, or are in some other way interested in the outcome of the project.

### Planning

#### Project Administration Plan

- plans how it will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed.
  - How are changes requested or approved?
  - How are components going to stored and version controlled?
  - How is progress measured?
  - Life-cycle, review points, milestones.
- Integration and consolidation of sub-plans / tasks.
- Define baseline of project: scope, schedule, costs.

#### Sub-plans

- Same as normal, but smaller scope contained within larger scope.
- second
- third

#### Work-Team Structures

Consider the following:

- Business context
- Size/scope of the task
- The novelty of the project
- Type of application
- Organization structures

#### RACI Matrix

make a matrix of people and tasks, where each person/task tuple has one of the following:

- Responsible
- Accountable
- Consulted
- Informed

Where each denotes a specific level/role in that task.

#### Project Charter

Document made by sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of the project and gives authority to the Project manager

**HIGH-LEVEl** DOCUMENT

Contains:

- Purpose
  - Description
  - Measurable objectives
  - Success Criteria
- Relevant Business Requirements
- Risks, Restrictions, and assumptions
- Approved resources
- Key stakeholders
- Project organization

#### Scope Administration

- Product Scope
  - Functionality of product or service.
- Project Scope
  - Work required to produce product or service.
  - Includes processes to ensure all and only the work required.
  
Works to define that which is within the project and that which is not.

Scope planning serves to identify and document the scope of a given project.

#### Work Breakdown Structure

[[todo]]

## Week 5

- Knowledge Areas
  - Time Management
    - Define activities
    - Sequence
    - Estimate resources and duration

### Time

- Dependence Between Activities
  - required dependencies
    - Inherent to the activity
    - Almost always physical limitation
  - Discretionary
    - Defined by administration Team
      - Best Practices (Do research first, etc.)
  - External Dependence
    - Imply relation between activities within project to activities outside of project.
- Diagrams
  - Gantt Chart
  - Milestone Chart
  - Precedence Diagramming method
    - Arrows connect activities.
  - Arrow diagramming method.
    - Arrows are activities
- Duration Estimation
  - Lag
    - Time between Activities
  - Critical Route
    - Longest dependency Chain
    - Shortest possible Time
  - Slack
    - Time a task can be delayed without delaying the project.
      - Critical Route tasks have 0 slack.
      - A project can have negative slack if critical task is delayed.
  - Fast tracking
    - Make parallel what was planned to be sequential.
    - Risky, often produces re-working
  - Crashing
    - Adding more resources to critical route tasks, while maintaining scope.
    - More costs
    - May not reduce time.
- Costs
  - Majority of costs are in the middle. (Life cycle of costs)
  - Variable Costs:
    - Whatever changes with the amount of product produced
  - Fixed cost:
    - Costs that aren't dependent on quantity.
  - Direct Cost:
    - Attributed directly to project (Travel, external resources, etc.)
  - Indirect Costs
  - Sunk Cost
- Progress Measurement

## Week 6

CMMi project planning

## week 7

- Design experiments
  - Start with idea
    - Brainstorm
    - research
    - "How might we...?"
  - Design
    - Hypothesis
    - Current condition.
    - **missing** 
  - result
    - A result is "good" if it provides statistically significant data.
  
## Week 8

- Risk Management
  - CMMi
    - Risk Repository
    - Areas
      - Prepare
        - Determine origin and category
        - Define parameters
        - Establish strategy
      - identify
        - Identify Risks
        - Evaluate Categorize and prioritize
      - Mitigate
        - Develop mitigation plans
        - Implement Mitigation Plans
  - PMI
    - Planning
    - Control
    - Risk definition:
      - Possibility of some event having an impact.
    - Purpose
      - Identify potential impacting factors
      - Determine probability
      - Determine impact
      - Determine when and how often
      - Create baseline for uncontrolled elements
      - Mitigate impacts
    - Sources Of Risk
      - historical records
      - Learned lessons
      - Org. Culture
      - WBS
      - Project charter
      - Stakeholders
      - assumptions
      - Objectives.

## Consejos practicos de un scrummaster

- Link work to outcome, not output
- Know your target audience
- Investigate the best way to do things - it's already been done.
