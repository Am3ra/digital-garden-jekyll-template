## Topic 1. Basic Concepts of the Compilation Process

### Class 1

What is a programming language?

> Special, defined notation to describe computer processes, in a manner understandable to both humans and computers.

#### Classifications of Programming Languages

- By Abstraction level:
    -  Low level
    
            Direct memory access
    -  Medium Level
    -  High Level

            Memory Access through operators
    -  Very High Level

            No memory access?
-  By historic evolution
    -  Machine language
    -  Associative language
    -  Procedural language
    -  Application language
    -  Inference language
    -  Neural Networks
-  By expression of Solution
    -  Imperative/Procedural
    -  Declarative
-  By Paradigm
    -  Imperative
    -  OOP
    -  Functional
    -  Logical
