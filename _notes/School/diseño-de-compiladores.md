## Topic 1. Basic Concepts of the Compilation Process

### Class 1

What is a programming language?

> Special, defined notation to describe computer processes, in a manner understandable to both humans and computers.

#### Classifications of Programming Languages

- By Abstraction level:
    - Low level

            Direct memory access
    - Medium Level
    - High Level

            Memory Access through operators
    - Very High Level

            No memory access?
    - By historic evolution
    - Machine language
    - Associative language
    - Procedural language
    - Application language
    - Inference language
    - Neural Networks
- By expression of Solution
     Imperative/Procedural
    - Declarative
- By Paradigm
    - Imperative
    - OOP
    - Functional
    - Logical

### Day 2 - Translation Process

Term | Definition
---  | ---
Translation | The process of exchanging equivalents.

Translation takes an input in language A, and either produces an equivalent in language B, or an error.

- Features of a Compiler
    - Translates from source code to object code
    - Can throw errors

### Steps of Compilations

1. Lexical Analysis
    - Determine if elements (tokens) exist in source language
    - Clean source code
        - remove whitespace
        - remove comments
        - (normalize capitalization)
2. Syntactic Analysis
   - Determine if sequence of elements conforms to correct structure
   - Structure is given by the language's grammar
3. Semantic Analysis
   - Determine the congruence of the elements according to meaning established as valid by the language.
   - Basically it's the type-checking system
4. Intermediate Code Generation (Optional)
5. Code optimization (Optional)
   - Step that minimizes time or space requirements of the code.
6. Object code generation
