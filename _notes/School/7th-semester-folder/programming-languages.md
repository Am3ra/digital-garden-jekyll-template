A course from [[university]], [[7th semester]]

## What is a programming language

Way to tell a machine what to do.

- Declarative Languages
  - Focus on what the computer has to do
- Imperative Languages
  - Focus on how the computer should do it.
  - Structured programming is the evolution
  - Object Oriented utilizes structured programming, adds restrictions and Objects.

## Levels of abstraction

low level languages provide almost no abstraction, and require a lot of knowledge about the architecture.

High-level languages provide useful abstractions to common problems, such as data structures.
They can possibly even abstract the computer architecture.

**All these categories are open to interpretation.**
