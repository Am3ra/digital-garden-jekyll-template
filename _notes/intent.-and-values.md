# Intent And Values

## Values

- Human suffering is, in general, bad. The opposite, however, is not always true. (Drugs, vices in general.)
- Education is a good [way to prevent suffering and promote happiness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-011-9874-x). The opposite is generally true.
- People Deserve Equal Chances.
  - I assume this to be true, mostly because I haven't found a justification to discriminate a class of people - especially those looked down upon by society such as felons or drug addicts.
- Equality is generally good for Everyone.

## Philosophy resulting from Values

I believe that one of the biggest promoters for human suffering is inequality among different groups along various dimensions. The most obvious dimensions for inequality are, in no particular order:

- Race
- Economic Class
- Ethnicity

Religion has played a big role  in both generating and maintaining this inequality, for example, Feudal Europe, modern Islam. It is not the main focus of my thoughts.

I believe that one of the most important axes of inequality is material or wealth inequality. Wealth inequality is what has permitted various forms of genocide, most recently of the Uighurs in China. Wealth inequality is what causes sweatshops in SE Asia, or permits starvation and malaria in Africa, or dehumanizes the homeless in most cities. As some lady said in a speech I recently heard, it's the difference between crack and cocaine.
