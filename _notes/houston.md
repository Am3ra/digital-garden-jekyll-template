Part of my [[life story]]

I've lived twice in houston, during elementary school, and during my sophmore year of highschool.

## First Stint (Elementary)

In elementary school, I studied first at a school who's name I can't remember, starts with S. Later, I moved to Hamilton Elementary.

At hamilton, I studied first and second grade with one of my most memorable teachers, Debbie Aramburu. She helped me to skip third grade, after which I studied fourth grade with Mrs. Collette, whom I have on facebook. I remember Mrs. Collette's classes more clearly, the emphasis that she gave to us learning idioms, and an interesting system of cards which we used everyday, that had something new to learn and do. I went to a forbidden city exhibit with her, had a wonderful time.

After fourth grade, I went to [[brazil]] to complete most of middle school and some of highschool, before returning to houston.

## Second Stint

My second time in houston is much more memorable. When I think of my year in houston, I think of several things: my track team, debate class with katarina dicklich (or something like that), geography class with my teacher that made us color maps and because of Ale Mayr whom I met there, and because of Mr. Husted and his Chemistry class which I so thoroughly enjoyed, in large part because of his great sense of humor.

Thinking back, I also remember my biology class, which to me was the simplest thing, and really didn't require me studying at all. I remember one of the guys from that class, and how he seemed so much like a lost puppy, since he always called me at night to ask for help with the homework, or with particularly tough topics. There, I met a girl whom I asked to the homecoming dance, though at the dance we didn't spend time with eachother.

My year in houston, looking back, because of how quickly it passed by, is almost surreal to me. It's incredible to think about how easily the whole system makes it for you to slot into your predetermined role. At least that's somehow how it felt. Everything was decided. Everything was easy. It was so predictable.

One weird incident was when my track coach went to my apartment to verify that I lived there.

I remember Abdul (abudi) Kalo, and his greek girlfriend, and the chats that we would have on the bus.

I remember Kaveri Dixit, my chindian friend, and the weird tension between us, I think we liked eachother. She was probably the funnest person I met. We danced at homecoming. I wonder where she is now.

I remember my horrible math teacher, and my horrible quasi-racist english teacher. I was the only one that said good morning to her daily.

I remember my debate classes, which I spent chatting with Katarina, who was somewhat mexican, or had a mexican mother, or something similar, though it didn't show. I think her father was polish.

After 10th grade, I went to  [[life-in-mexico]].
