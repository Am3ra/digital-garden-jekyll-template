When talking about the illusion of climate change, I want to begin by saying that Climate Change is a very real phenomenon that we as a society should be more worried about.

The illusion is, of course, not about what is actually happening, but rather the cause of the phenomenon. It is rather well known that the main cause of the worst effects of climate change are everyday people, driving to work, drinking coffee, and using straws... or is it?

Given this fact, there is nothing more to do than try to recycle your plastics ([which doesn't really work,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnJ8mK3Q3g) [and that isn't your fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVBkjMbF4Z4)), and bake your own bread, or whatever ... or is there?
