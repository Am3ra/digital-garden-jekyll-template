When talking about the illusion of climate change, I want to begin by saying that Climate Change is a very real phenomenon that we as a society should be more worried about.

The illusion is, of course, not about what is actually happening, but rather the cause of the phenomenon. It is rather well known that the main cause of the worst effects of climate change are everyday people, driving to work, drinking coffee, and using straws... or is it?

Given this fact, there is nothing more to do than try to recycle your plastics ([which doesn't really work,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnJ8mK3Q3g) [and that isn't your fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVBkjMbF4Z4)), and bake your own bread, or whatever ... or is there?

## The Real Causes of CO2 emissions

Contrary to what the media in general [would have you  believe (Seriously, look at this article to see how Packaging Conglomerates teamed up to shift the blame to consumers, away from industry)](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-indian-crying-environment-ads-pollution-1123-20171113-story.html), the main culprit of global contamination  is not, and hasn't been private citizens. In fact, looking at the [graphs](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/?country=WORLD&fuel=CO2%20emissions&indicator=CO2BySector), while residential CO2 emissions have remained stable since the 90's, energy production at around 1.8 Gt of CO2, energy production has exploded from slightly over 20 Gt of CO2 to almost 35 Gt of CO2 in 30 years, a 75% increase. This is something that no amount of recycling will be able to solve.

The largest culprits for [CO2 emissions](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=WORLD&fuel=CO2%20emissions&indicator=CO2BySector) are (in order), Energy and Heat production (13.98 Gt), transport (8.25 Gt), and industry (6.15 Gt). 

This is something which is easy to find, but most people don't know. While people are collectively responsible (i.e. who we choose as government leaders), we are not personally responsible (the cause isn't that most people don't recycle).

### Wealth

[The top 1% of people pollute more than TWICE the bottom 50%](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621052/mb-confronting-carbon-inequality-210920-en.pdf):

>The richest 10% of the worlds population (c.630 million people) were responsible for 52% of the cumulative carbon emissions – depleting the global carbon budget by nearly a third (31%) in those 25 years alone.  The poorest 50% (c. 3.1 billion people) were responsible for just 7% of cumulative emissions, and used just 4% of the available carbon budget; The richest 1% (c.63 million people) alone were responsible for 15% of cumulative emissions, and 9% of the carbon budget – twice as much as the poorest half of the world's population; The richest 5% (c.315 million people) were responsible for over a third (37%) of the total growth in emissions, while the total growth in emissions of the richest 1% was three times that of the poorest 50%

The ONLY way to come close to stopping global warming is to implement policies (such as carbon taxes and reparations taxes) that limit the impact of the richest people on the rest of us. I really recommend you read the article to see the impact of wealth inequality on climate change.


### Country

If you don't live within the U.S. or China, chances are, even as a country you don't contribute much to climate change. China accounts for 28% by itself (almost a third),  the U.S 15%, and almost every other industrialized nation hovering around 1 or 2% of world-wide CO2 emissions.  **43%** of worldwide emissions are due to 2 countries. Again, this is not to say that other countries don't play a role, only to point out the biggest players. 

>On a per capita basis, China is doing better than the U.S., but nowhere near as well as india, which has a similarly-sized population.


## What YOU can actually do.

So although the point of this article is to say that most of the things that most people do to combat climate change aren't effective, that isn't to say that no actions a person can take are effective, or not to do things such as recycle. Rather, the point is that while these actions are helpful, it's more useful to invest your energy in other places.

### Personal Measures

Avoid using planes as much as possible, and use public transport as much as possible.

### Political Actions

The main response to these large-scale systemic problems *has to be* political.

- Learn about Local/National Politics
- Join organizations
    - Take part in events such as marches or protests

## What Countries Should Do

### The carbon tax

### Waste tax

Instead
