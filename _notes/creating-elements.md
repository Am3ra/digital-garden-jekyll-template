this is an attempt at cataloguing my recent foray into web components. 
This is a note referencing [[about this site]]


Recently, I've begun to look into jekyll includes, and how to use them to, well, *include* new components such as popups into my jekyll pages.
Thinking of that, I finally stumbled onto [*This Site*](https://daverupert.com/2017/07/jekyll-includes-are-cool/), which opened a whole new world to me.
Looking at this, I want to experiment more with Polymer, a web components library built by google.
[This seems to be a workable tutorial.](https://blog.webjeda.com/integrate-polymer-jekyll/)

Lets import and use a component.
