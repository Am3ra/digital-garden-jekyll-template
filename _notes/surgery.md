On august 16th (I think), I had maxilofacial surgery in the city of Guadalajara. 

The surgery had a drastic effect on my life, especially since in preperation for it, I shaved my incredibly long hair.

When I cut my hair,  it took my a couple of days to recognize myself, after years of growing my hair out.

When I had surgery, my face swelled up, quite like a balloon, actually! I was never in pain, since my facial nerves were completely numb (6 months later, a section of my jaw is still numb)out.

Weirdly, as opposed to when I shaved my head, I feel like my face now is  more aligned with my self-image, reason for which it toook me less time to adjust to the new look.

The recovery was an interesting experience: I had just begun work in [[sparkademy]], the previous july, and had to ask them for weeks off. The school semester had begun as well, and being my last semester, it felt especially important to me. Juggling the three, was somewhat complicated.

For a but more than a month, I ate completely liquid foods, which my parents prepared for me. We lived in a hotel room during that recovery period, in order for me to be able to be close to my hyperbaric chamber treatments. The chamber was somewhat claustrophobic, and was glad when they were over.
