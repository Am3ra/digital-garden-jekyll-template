Respira.
Respiro.
Respira hondo.

An old internet joke is to write "you are now breathing manually", in order to make you self-conscious about your breathing. It's a way to tell the reader: look how much power my words have, I can even change the way you breath. It's also just annoying that some text can order us that way. 

I think that the best way to start a journey or a story is breathing in deeply, so I will, before I start, as I suggest you do as well.

In a forest path, on a summer's day, we meet our protagonist. He seems troubled as he looks behind him.
