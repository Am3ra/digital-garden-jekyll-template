Motivation is an integral part of everyday life.

It dictates in large regard what you do and why.

How does motivation affect you? Are you motivated? Why or why not? Here are some theories that may help you understand yourself and those around you.

## Maslows Theory of Needs

Maslow is probably the most famous of all, so won't go too deeply into him. However, to use his theories in self reflection, there are certain questions we can pose:

1. Are my basic needs being met?
	1. Do I have enough sleep?
	2. Am I eating well?
	3. Exercising enough?
2. Do you have a good support net?
3. Is what you do fulfilling?

These questions, though simple, can lead to pretty profound reflection. I recommend writing out your reasoning for each!

## Hertzberg's Theory

I touch briefly on this in [[Employee Pipeline]], and why Hertzberg's Motivating factors back it up.

Hertzberg describes motivation in terms of a person's environment, and divides the environment into two: Hygiene Factors and Motivating factors.

Hygiene Factors are those that we expect to be there, but whose existence doesn't motivate us. However, if it *isn't* there, we are demoralized. For example clean toilets. No-one (I hope) goes to work only for their clean toilets. However, not having clean toilets would be seriously distracting

Motivating factors are exactly that, things that drive us forward, not only maintain us where we are. For example, recognition, mastery, and growth.

### Key questions:

1. Are you being recognized?
2. are your environmental standards met?
3. 


## Pink's Theory

Read his book: Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us (2009)

[Daniel pink](https://www.toolshero.com/psychology/daniel-pink-motivation-theory/) divides motivators into two camps: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation.

Intrinsic motivation is exactly what it sounds like: an internal drive to see an outcome, such as personal preferences.

Extrinsic motivation is more environmental, and is how your environment shapes your actions. For example, doing more to get a bonus, or studying to avoid bad grades.

Pink has three main pillars of motivation: Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose

Autonomy — how self-sufficient you are, how much you direct your own life

Mastery — How good you are at what you do. Think about how frustrating it can be to learn something like a new language, and how rewarding it can be to speak it fluently

Purpose — Self-esteem and drive to do better by ourselves. 

> Many students are demotivated in class because they don't understand the purpose - 'Why do I need to learn this?' and 'Will Iever usethis in my future career?'.

Purpose and context creates motivation.

>employees who understand how their individual roles contribute to the purpose (vision)oftheir organization are far more likely to be satisfied in their work.
