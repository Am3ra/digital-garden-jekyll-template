[[Entertainment]]

Although I was generally aware of Formula one during my youth, I never really found it accessible. I became a fan after watching Netflix's "Drive to Survive" series.

The 2021 Season is my first full season!

Checo Perez is my favorite driver at the moment, mostly because he's mexican, but also because he's quite good, but not the best. It's a real treat when he wins.
